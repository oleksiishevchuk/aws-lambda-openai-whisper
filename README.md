# AWS S3/Lambda integaration with Open AI API (Whisper) and AWS CDK
This solution demonstrates AWS S3/Lambda integration with Open AI speech to text API (Whisper model) to transcribe/translate audio files to the text format. AWS resources are deployed using AWS CDK infrastructure as code.

## Architecture
![Architecture](/docs/architecture.png)

## Demo (audio transcription)
1. Upload audio file to the S3 bucket.
![upload_audio_transcription](/docs/upload_audio_transcription.png)
2. Lambda function sends file to the Open AI API (Whisper) to create a transcription and uploads it as a text file to output S3 bucket.

3. Transcription result:
```json
{
   "text" : "He doesn't belong to you, and I don't see how you have anything to do with what is be his power yet. He's heaped us all in that from the stage to you. Be fine."
}
```

## Demo (audio translation)
1. Upload audio file to the S3 bucket.

3. Translation result:
```json
{
   "text" : "Hi, I'm Ram√≥n Langa, and I'm a beautiful person. In fact, I bring home everything I win. Besides, I'm the best speaker in the world. That's it."
}
```
